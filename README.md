<h2>Stack description 💻</h2>
<p><b>Open Space</b> is a <b>React 18</b> application that uses external <b>Open Notify API</b>.</p>
<p><b>Vite</b> was used as a project building and initializing tool.</p>
<p>According to best React practices, application code base includes reusable components, props validation and custom hooks for repeated logic.</p>
<p>Components styling is applied using CSS modules that allows scoping class names and animations locally.</p>
